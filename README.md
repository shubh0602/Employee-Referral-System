# Employee Referral System AKA HRMS
"Employee Referral System". Typically used to handle the Job Listing and Resume Upload. This system would be used to create Job Listing by HR/Admin
(Role Based) and Employee's would be able to view and upload resume for respective Job and would be able to Share the job.

NOTE: This is a sample project which is intented to showcase development using AngularJs and this would be my hobby project which may or may not be helpful to others.
